The static-dashboards files can just be loaded off disk as file urls.

If you need to test the server, use appengine's dev_appserver to start
a localhost server.

Run the web tests via static-dashboards/run-unittests.html.

Run the python tests one python _tests file at a time. You need to
add the following to your PYTHON_PATH first though. Fill in the
CHROMIUM_ROOT and APPENGINE_INSTALL_LOCATION with the approrpiate
paths.

export PYTHON_PATH=PYTHON_PATH:CHROMIUM_ROOT/src/third_party/WebKit/Tools/TestResultServer:APPENGINE_INSTALL_LOCATION:APPENGINE_INSTALL_LOCATION/lib/yaml/lib:APPENGINE_INSTALL_LOCATION/lib/webapp2-2.5.2:APPENGINE_INSTALL_LOCATION/lib/webob-1.2.3

PUSHING
Fill in the revision you're pushing for XXXX.
1. appcfg.py update . --version rXXXX
2. Go to appengine.google.com and select the test-results-hrd app.
3. Click on the version tab
4. Make the rXXXX version the default

The versioning is so that we can easily roll back if there's something
wrong with the push and so we can know what we've pushed.

If you're unsure about whether you might have broken things, before
step 4, you can click on the link for that version to see that
version of the server before you make it the default.
