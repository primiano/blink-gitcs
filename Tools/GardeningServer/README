sheriff-o-matic must be run from a server in order to handle polymer imports correctly.

1. cd Tools
2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3. Load http://localhost:8000/GardeningServer/sheriff-o-matic.html

Run the tests via http://localhost:8000/GardeningServer/run-unittests.html.

Polymer must be synced via bower in order for anything to work.

INSTALLING NPM/BOWER
The version of npm in apt-get is too old for bower. Instead
install it from http://nodejs.org/download/.

Install bower with:
    sudo npm install -g bower

SYNCING POLYMER
1. cd Tools/GardeningServer
2. bower update

PUSHING
Fill in the revision you're pushing for XXXX.
1. appcfg.py update . --version rXXXX
2. Go to appengine.google.com and select the sheriff-o-matic app.
3. Click on the version tab
4. Make the rXXXX version the default

The versioning is so that we can easily roll back if there's something
wrong with the push and so we can know what we've pushed.

If you're unsure about whether you might have broken things, before
step 4, you can click on the link for that version to see that
version of the server before you make it the default.
