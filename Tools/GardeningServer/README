garden-o-matic must be run from a server in order to handle polymer imports correctly.

1. cd Tools
2. python -m SimpleHTTPServer
3. Load http://localhost:8000/GardeningServer/garden-o-matic.html

Run the tests via http://localhost:8000/GardeningServer/run-unittests.html.

Polymer must be synced via bower in order for anything to work.

INSTALLING NPM/BOWER
The version of npm in apt-get is too old for bower. Instead
install it from http://nodejs.org/download/.

Install bower with:
    sudo npm install -g bower

SYNCING POLYMER
1. cd Tools/GardeningServer
2. bower update
