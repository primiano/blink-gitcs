This test verifies the functionality of the OES_vertex_array_object extension, if it is available.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


PASS WebGL context exists
Testing binding enum with extension disabled
PASS getError was expected value: INVALID_ENUM : VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES should not be queryable if extension is disabled
PASS Successfully enabled OES_vertex_array_object extension
PASS OES_vertex_array_object listed as supported and getExtension succeeded
Testing binding enum with extension enabled
PASS ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES is 0x85B5
PASS getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES query should succeed if extension is enable
PASS Default value of VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES is null
Testing binding a VAO
PASS gl.getParameter(ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES) is null
FAIL gl.getParameter(ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES) is not expected VAO
FAIL gl.getParameter(ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES) is not expected VAO
PASS gl.getParameter(ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES) is null
PASS getError was expected value: INVALID_OPERATION : binding a deleted vertex array object
PASS gl.getParameter(ext.VERTEX_ARRAY_BINDING_OES) is null
Testing object creation
PASS getError was expected value: NO_ERROR : createVertexArrayOES should not set an error
PASS vao is non-null.
PASS ext.isVertexArrayOES(vao) is false
FAIL ext.isVertexArrayOES(vao) should be true. Was false.
FAIL ext.isVertexArrayOES(vao) should be true. Was false.
