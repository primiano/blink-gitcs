CONSOLE WARNING: line 8: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-frame.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/mixedContent/resources/boring.html': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.

This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure iframe. We should *not* get a mixed content callback becase the main frame is HTTP and the grandchild iframe doesn't contaminate the child iframe's security origin with mixed content.
