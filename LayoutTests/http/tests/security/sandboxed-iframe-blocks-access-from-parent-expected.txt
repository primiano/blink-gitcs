CONSOLE MESSAGE: Sandbox access violation: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/resources/blank.html from frame with URL http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/sandboxed-iframe-blocks-access-from-parent.html. The frame being accessed is sandboxed into a unique origin.

CONSOLE MESSAGE: line 12: SecurityError: DOM Exception 18: An attempt was made to break through the security policy of the user agent.
