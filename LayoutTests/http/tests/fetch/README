This directory contains Fetch API layout tests. As it is exposed to Window and
Worker, most (if not all) of tests are expected to run on Window and Worker.
For each test (say X), we have a script X.js in /fetch/script-tests,
/fetch/X.html Window test file and /fetch/workers/X.html Worker test file.

PRESUBMIT.py checks above. For each file in /fetch/script-tests, the
corresponding html files must exist in /fetch and /fetch/workers directories.

Other resources such as helper JS files and server side scripts are located on
/fetch/resources.

Tests should conform to Service Worker Testing style[1].
