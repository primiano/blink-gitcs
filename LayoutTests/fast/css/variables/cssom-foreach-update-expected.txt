This tests expected behaviour when modifying variables in a CSSVariablesMap during a forEach() loop.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".



Test adding variable in forEach() over "var-existing: pass;"
PASS log[0] is "Iteration (var-existing: pass)"
PASS log[1] is "Add variable (var-added: pass)"

PASS log.length is 3

Test deleting variable in forEach() over "var-existing: pass; var-to-delete: fail;"
PASS log[0] is "Iteration (var-existing: pass)"
PASS log[1] is "Delete variable (var-to-delete)"
PASS log.length is 2

Test clearing variables in forEach() over "var-existing: pass; var-to-clear: fail;"
PASS log[0] is "Iteration (var-existing: pass)"
