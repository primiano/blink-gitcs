This tests accessing form elements by name. IE updates collections immediatelly after name changes, but A collection never be changed to a single node when the number of matched nodes becomes 1. Firefox remembers every name item has been accessed with, but forgets items that have not been accessed. We follow the standard behavior. i.e. collections are updated immediately, and it's changed to a single node when the size becomes 1.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".
