Check stepUp() and stepDown() bahevior for number type.

On success, you will see a series of "PASS" messages, followed by "TEST COMPLETE".


Number type
Invalid value
PASS stepUp("", null, null) threw exception InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'stepUp' on 'HTMLInputElement': The form element's current value is not a number..

PASS input.value is "1"
PASS stepDown("1", "3.40282346e+38", "", 2) threw exception InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'stepDown' on 'HTMLInputElement': The form element's new value (-6.80564692e+38) would be lower than the minimum (-3.4028234663852886e+38), and snapping to the minimum would exceed the amount of acceptible error..
PASS stepUp("-1", "1", "0") is "0"
PASS stepUp("0", "1", "0") threw exception InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'stepUp' on 'HTMLInputElement': The form element's new value (1) would be higher than the maximum (0), and snapping to the maximum would exceed the amount of acceptible error..
PASS stepUp("-1", "1", "0", 2) threw exception InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'stepUp' on 'HTMLInputElement': The form element's new value (1) would be higher than the maximum (0), and snapping to the maximum would exceed the amount of acceptible error..
PASS input.value is "-1"
PASS stepUp("1", "3.40282346e+38", "", 2) threw exception InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'stepUp' on 'HTMLInputElement': The form element's new value (6.80564692e+38) would be higher than the maximum (3.4028234663852886e+38), and snapping to the maximum would exceed the amount of acceptible error..
stepDown()/stepUp() for stepMismatch values
PASS stepUp("1", "2", "") is "3"
PASS input.stepDown(); input.value is "1"
