This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Scroll x:1, y:2, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:2, y:3, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:3, y:4, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:4, y:5, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:3, y:undefined, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:undefined, y:4, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:undefined, y:undefined, smooth:false 
FAIL Scroll x:10, y:15, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "13, 18" but got "23, 33"
FAIL Scroll x:20, y:25, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "23, 33" but got "43, 58"
FAIL Scroll x:30, y:35, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "43, 58" but got "73, 93"
FAIL Scroll x:40, y:45, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "73, 93" but got "113, 138"
FAIL Scroll x:-30, y:undefined, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "113, 138" but got "83, 138"
