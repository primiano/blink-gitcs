This is a testharness.js-based test.
PASS Scroll x:1, y:2, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:2, y:3, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:3, y:4, smooth:false 
PASS Scroll x:4, y:5, smooth:false 
FAIL Scroll x:10, y:15, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "10, 14" but got "20, 29"
FAIL Scroll x:20, y:25, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "20, 29" but got "40, 54"
FAIL Scroll x:30, y:35, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "40, 54" but got "70, 89"
FAIL Scroll x:40, y:45, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "70, 89" but got "110, 134"
FAIL Scroll x:4000, y:4100, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "110, 134" but got "4110, 4234"
FAIL Scroll x:-3900, y:-3850, smooth:true assert_equals: expected "4110, 4234" but got "210, 384"
