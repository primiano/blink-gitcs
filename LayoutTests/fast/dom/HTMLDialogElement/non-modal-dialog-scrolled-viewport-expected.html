This tests that a dialog's containing block is the initial containing block.
The dialog is positioned at (1200, 1200) and the window is scrolled to (1000,
1000) so the dialog should be positioned at (200, 200) relative to the viewport.
</p>
<div class="pseudodialog" style="top: 1200px; left: 1200px; right: auto; height: 250px; width: 50%; background-color: yellow">
    This dialog should be onscreen with a width of 50% of the viewport. It is the child of an narrow element
    positioned off screen, but its containing block is the initial containing block, so its
    position and percent lengths are relative to that.
