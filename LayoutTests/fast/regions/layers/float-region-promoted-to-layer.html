        <p>Testing that regions become layers as required by the content that display in those regions.
        In this case the region is also a float and we are testing that the correct enclosing
        layer will paint the region as needed. In this case box1 is responsible of painting
        the first region, even though the whole element fits inside box2.
        There should be two boxes: one taller gray box and one orange box. The orange box has a black border.
        The test fails if there's any red on screen.
