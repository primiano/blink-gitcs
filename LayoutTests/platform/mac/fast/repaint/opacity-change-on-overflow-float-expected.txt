Repaint test for REGRESSION (r41203): Facebook friend suggestions disappear on update. Make sure when a layer switches from being self-painting to non-self-painting that a layout happens to fix up the floating objects lists. You should see a 100x100 green square below. If you see any red, the test has failed.
