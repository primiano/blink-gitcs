Even though the fixed-position element's container is nonscrollable, it should still be composited because one of its ancestors is scrolling.

{
  "bounds": [800, 600],
  "children": [
    {
      "bounds": [800, 600],
      "contentsOpaque": true,
      "drawsContent": true,
      "children": [
        {
          "position": [10, 100],
          "bounds": [100, 100],
          "contentsOpaque": true,
          "drawsContent": true,
          "backgroundColor": "#00FF00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
