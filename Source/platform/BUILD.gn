# Chromium's version of WebCore includes the following Objective-C classes. The
# system-provided WebCore framework may also provide these classes. Because of
# the nature of Objective-C binding (dynamically at runtime), it's possible for
# the Chromium-provided versions to interfere with the system-provided
# versions. This may happen when a system framework attempts to use
# core.framework, such as when converting an HTML-flavored string to an
# NSAttributedString. The solution is to force Objective-C class names that
# would conflict to use alternate names.
#
# This list will hopefully shrink but may also grow. Its performance is
# monitored by the "Check Objective-C Rename" postbuild step, and any
# suspicious-looking symbols not handled here or whitelisted in that step will
# cause a build failure.
#
# If this is unhandled, the console will receive log messages
# such as:
# com.google.Chrome[] objc[]: Class ScrollbarPrefsObserver is implemented in both .../Google Chrome.app/Contents/Versions/.../Google Chrome Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/../../../Google Chrome Framework.framework/Google Chrome Framework and /System/Library/Frameworks/WebKit.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/WebCore.framework/Versions/A/WebCore. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.
